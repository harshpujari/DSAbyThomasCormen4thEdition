Memory Usage
A mobile app processing user photos can't load all images into memory simultaneously. An algorithm that uses less RAM prevents crashes on devices with limited memory, even if it's slightly slower.

Energy Consumption
A fitness tracker running 24/7 must prioritize battery-efficient algorithms over speed. A heart rate monitoring algorithm that extends battery life from 2 to 5 days is more valuable than one that's 10% faster but drains the battery.

Accuracy vs Speed Trade-offs
A medical diagnostic system might choose a slower algorithm that's 99.8% accurate over a faster one that's 95% accurate. The cost of misdiagnosis far outweighs processing time.

Scalability
A social media platform's friend suggestion algorithm must handle millions of users. An approach that works well for 1,000 users but degrades exponentially isn't viable, even if it's initially faster.

Network Bandwidth
A video streaming service optimizes for minimal data transfer rather than processing speed. Compressing video efficiently reduces bandwidth costs and prevents buffering for users with slow connections.

Storage Space
A backup system might use slower compression algorithms that save 40% more storage space, reducing long-term costs significantly.

Development Time
A startup might choose a simple, proven algorithm they can implement in one week over a complex, optimized solution requiring three months of development.Ë€
