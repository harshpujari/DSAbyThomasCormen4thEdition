Sorting Example: Emergency Response System

I manage a city's emergency dispatch system. When a 911 call comes in, I need to sort all available ambulances by their response time to the incident location. The system calculates each ambulance's estimated arrival time based on current traffic, distance, and vehicle status, then sorts them from fastest to slowest response time. The dispatcher assigns the quickest ambulance, potentially saving critical minutes in life-threatening situations.

Shortest Distance Example: Delivery Route Optimization

I run a local bakery with daily deliveries to 15 restaurants. Each morning, I need to find the shortest route that visits all locations and returns to the bakery. Using GPS coordinates, I calculate distances between every pair of locations, then determine the optimal sequence that minimizes total driving distance. This reduces fuel costs, delivery time, and allows my driver to complete more routes per day. Yesterday's route was 23 miles instead of the 31 miles it would have been with random ordering.
