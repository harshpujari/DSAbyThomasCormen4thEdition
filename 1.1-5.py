Only the Best Solution Will Do: Nuclear Reactor Control System

A nuclear power plant's automatic shutdown system must calculate the precise control rod insertion sequence to safely stop a reactor during an emergency. The algorithm has milliseconds to determine the exact positioning that prevents meltdown while avoiding dangerous power oscillations. An "approximately correct" solution could result in reactor damage, radiation release, or catastrophic failure. The system must guarantee mathematical precision - there's no acceptable margin for "close enough" when public safety and environmental disaster are at stake.

Approximately Best is Good Enough: Netflix Movie Recommendations

Netflix's recommendation algorithm suggests movies you might enjoy based on viewing history, ratings, and user similarities. The system doesn't need to find the theoretically perfect movie for you - it just needs to suggest something you'll probably like better than random selection. Whether the algorithm identifies your ideal movie or your second-best choice makes little practical difference. Users are satisfied if 7 out of 10 recommendations are appealing, and the cost of computing a mathematically optimal recommendation for each user would be prohibitive. A "good enough" solution that runs quickly and suggests decent content serves the business purpose effectively.

Key Difference:
The nuclear system has binary success/failure with catastrophic consequences, while the recommendation system has gradual quality degradation with minimal real-world impact.
